# R

## Variables & Data Types:

- Important points while writing Identifiers in R:
    Identifiers can have a combination of letters, digits, one period . and one underscore _.
    However, they must start with a letter or a period. If it starts with a period, it cannot be followed by a digit.
    Reserved words in R cannot be used as identifiers!

R has **five main data types**:

    1. Character

    2. Complex

    3. Integer

    4. Logical

    5. Numeric

        - Real

        - Decimal

    You can see these all in test.R

### All about Strings:

**Escape Sequences**:

 - You can use escape sequences to include special characters in our strings.

 Common escape sequences include:

 \n - newline

 \t - tab

 \\ - backslash

 \' - single quote

 \" - double quote

 See string methods in test.R
